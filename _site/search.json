    "text": "About Me\nHello and welcome to my website! My name is Jared Seneca Adam and I currently reside in Montana, where I spend most of my time running around the woods and clambering up rocks, all while looking at, and for, plants and arthropods. I am considered an Entomologist by most, a Quantitative Ecologist by some, and in a former life, I was an Agroecologist. I am from a small town in Northeastern Pennsylvania, where I spent much of time wrestling, playing baseball, skateboarding, hunting, and fishing. Indeed, I was a bug kid, but it was not until my junior year of undergrad that I learned studying arthropods could be a career. From that moment on, I dedicated much of time to learning all I could about insects and other arthropods. I added the entomology minor to my course load which added a year to my degree, took graduate-level courses, sought internships with a focus on entomology, and started considering graduate programs.\nUpon the completion of my undergraduate degree in December 2019, I joined Peace Corps Nepal. Regrettably, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March of 2020, the Peace Corps underwent a global evacuation from all countries. Upon returning to the US, I got a job in agri-chemical research at Lehigh Agricultural and Biological Services. I had interned here as an undergraduate, so, the transition to a full-time employee was all but seamless. In 2021, I went back to Penn State to work for (Dr. John Wallace) in the Weed Science department. While I loved working for Wallace, my passion was (and still is), and in 2022 I finally joined it into my first entomology lab. In August of 2022, I started a Master’s degree with (Dr. John Tooker).\nAt present, I am a PhD student of Dr. Will Wetzel (Wetzel lab) in the Land Resources and Environmental Sciences program in the College of Agriculture at Montana State University. My interests include tri-tropic interactions (plant-herbivore-predator) and how these populations change with changes in elevation. Additionally, I am interested in how climate change may be driving asynchronous movement of these groups across elevations and how this effects plant, herbivore, and predator fitness. Within this framework, I investigate how herbivore tolerance and trait-based responses to abiotic stress lead to predicting plant fitness.\nMy master’s thesis with Dr. John Tooker (Tooker lab) broadly focused on Integrated Pest Management within conventional row crops.

I am broadly interested in how global environmental change drives plant-insect interactions. My work focuses on plant tolerance to herbivore and I seek to understand how plants can, or cannot, handle increase in both abiotic and biotic stress. For example, how does an increase in abiotic stress drive insect-herbivore populations? What physiological traits do plants rely to handle in increase in the dual threat of abiotic and biotic pressure? Can we predict the role of arthropod predators in plant fitness?"
